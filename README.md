# Future of Coding â€¢ Code of Conduct

Future of Coding is an online community with a welcoming, cooperative, and [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines) spirit. We are unified in the belief that the common practice of programming is tragically less [humane](http://worrydream.com/#!/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThoughtTalk) than it could be. There's a world of [possibilities](https://dynamicland.org) that get more beautiful the further away from the norm you go. We're here to explore this world together, to discuss ideas about theory and practice, and to champion and support our members' research and development efforts.

One of many principles held by the community is that computing currently reflects the interests of a narrow minority of people. A directed effort is needed to broaden the accessibility of computing and amplify the influence of historically under-represented people in shaping its future. This code of conduct is one part of that effort.

It's called a "code of conduct" so that people are easily able to locate it, but don't get hung up on the name. The goal is that this document should help you feel more confident participating in our community by knowing what values we hold and how we express them.

The code of conduct applies to all community-affiliated spaces, including but not limited to the Slack, podcast, websites, repos, wikis, and meetups organized within the community. The examples listed below are illustrative, not exhaustive. When in doubt, ask! The moderators listed near the bottom will be happy to listen and help however they can.

### Sharing

We encourage you to
* Share your own work! Share the deep technical details. Start a wide-ranging discussion about the design of your work and how it'll advance a more humane future of computing.
* Share thoughts that you have, or things that you find, in the form of blog posts, talks, papers, books, conferences, wikis, repos, communities, trivia, quotes, rants, jokes, art, and all other expressions related to the past, present, or future of programming.

We discourage
* New members linking to startups, for-profit products, or other commercial interests, unless you also foster discussion about the work that relates it to our community's interests (as described above).
* Excessive self-promotion. While we encourage you to share and discuss your own work, you should join our community because you want to participate more broadly than that, and not because you want to hire, network, raise awareness, etc.

Please note that all things posted to the community are public and may be shared outside the community or stored in perpetuity, except for private direct messages which should not be shared without the consent of all involved parties.

### Behaviour

We encourage you to
* Discuss the work of community members in the ways that they invite. If someone asks broadly for feedback on their work, please be kind in your critique, focus on the work itself, and be constructive. If someone asks for a specific kind of feedback (like encouragement, or feedback on a specific aspect of the work), please respect that request.
* Critique or criticize the material that other community members share links to, but please be respectful toward both the author of those materials and the person who shared them.
* Discuss politics, economics, class, representation, intersectionality, social movements and dynamics, and other related maters. Computing emerges from humanity, and thus societal context is essential for a full understanding of the issues faced by programmers and users now and in the future.

We do not allow
* Hurtful behaviour about or toward any person. This includes but is not limited to: ableism, homophobia, racism, sexism, transphobia, religious discrimination, violent language or threats, insults or name-calling, personal attacks, condescension, demeaning language, deliberate intimidation, discriminatory jokes or language.

We have zero tolerance for people who commit acts of harassment, hate speech, or abuse anywhere, whether inside or outside the community.
