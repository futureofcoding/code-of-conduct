# Future of Coding • Code of Conduct

Future of Coding is an online community that welcomes all people. We discuss ideas about programming technology and practice, and support our members' work on relevant projects. One of many principles held by the community is that computing currently reflects the interests of a narrow minority of people, and thus a directed effort is needed to broaden and equalize the appeal of computing and the influence of historically under-represented people in shaping its future. This code of conduct is one part of that effort.

The code of conduct applies to all community-affiliated spaces, including but not limited to the Slack, community repos, wikis, and meetups organized within the community.

The encouragements and restrictions listed below are illustrative, not exhaustive. If you have any uncertainty about what is or isn't allowed, don't hesitate to ask a moderator.

### Self-promotion

We encourage you to
* Share your work! We love to discuss relevant projects and ideas of any shape or size.

We do not allow
* Exclusive self-promotion. While you are welcome to share and discuss your work, we ask that you also participate in other discussions in ways that go beyond simply directing people to your project.

### Sharing

We encourage you to
* Share thoughts that you have, or things that you find, in the form of blog posts, talks, papers, conferences, wikis, repos, communities, trivia, quotes, rants, jokes, art, and all other expressions related to the past, present, or future of programming.

We do not allow
* Sharing any materials that violate this code of conduct.

### Behaviour

We encourage you to
* Discuss the work of community members in the ways that they invite. If someone asks broadly for feedback on their work, please be kind in your critique and focus on the work itself. If someone asks for a specific kind of feedback (like encouragement, or feedback on a specific aspect of the work), please respect that request.
* Deeply discuss the materials that other community members share. Critique and criticism — even abject dismissal — is welcome, so long as it is focussed on the material shared and related ideas, and not on the person sharing. Criticism of the author of shared materials, even if they are not present in the community, must also abide by this code of conduct — they are no less deserving of respect than the members of our community.
* Discuss politics, issues of class and representation, affiliation, governance, social movements and dynamics, and other related maters — but only insofar as is relevant to the state of computing as it currently exists, and not in a way that is targeted at or could be hurtful to individuals in the community.

We expressly forbid
* All forms of harassment. This includes but is not limited to: violent language or threats, insults or name-calling, personal attacks, condescension, demeaning language, deliberate intimidation, sexism, racism, transphobia, ableism, discriminatory jokes or language.

### Scope

If you see or experience a violation of this code of conduct, please report it to any of the moderators listed below:

* Ivan Reese (Slack, Twitter, Email)
* (If you would like to be a moderator, please contact Ivan for consideration)

Moderators may take any of the following measures, at their discretion:
* Privately contact the offending individuals and advise them of the violation.
* Delete posts or messages.
* Temporarily or permanently ban serial offenders.
* Permanently ban people who commit any overt, intentional, or inexcusable act of harassment on the first offence.
* Revise this code of conduct to more clearly define encouraged and discouraged forms of participation.

People permanently banned from the community will be immediately removed from all community-affiliated spaces, including but not limited to the Slack, community repos, wikis, and meetups organized within the community. Temporary bans will be enacted variably based on the nature of the violation.

Please note that all things posted to the community are public and may be shared outside the community and stored in perpetuity, except for private direct messages which must not be shared without the permission of all involved parties.
